## What is Untitled Lunar Application?

Untitled Lunar Application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for a certain 'anime' RPG game that allows the ability to create relics easily.

## Features

1. Updated for Anime RPG Game. 2.1
2. 4-Party Setup
3. 6 Relic Slots (4 for Main Relics + 2 SU Relics)
4. Creation of Standard, Max, "Penta-BIS" and Custom Relics.
  > "Penta-BIS" is what I call Relics that are Level +0, but who's substats are +5 (basically a maxed out +15 relic). Basically, 4 substats at +5 is 4 relics at +15. Ascending the Relic to +15 gets you +75 which has some stats go to (6-10).
6. Relic and Character Names
7. Easy command outputs to LunarCore (using Java console or March 7th console).

## How to use

## Q&A

Q: GUI?
A: Thinking of doing a GUI but I have to learn Tkinter or PyQt or something of that nature. Plus it probably won't look great :p
